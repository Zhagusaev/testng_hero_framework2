Alerts

We have three kinds of alert
1- Operation System Alert
Selenium can not handle OS alerts. We need to use third party tools like AutoIT, Robot Framework.
2- JavaScript alert
Selenium can handle javascript alerts using Alert class. We can accept or decline this kind of alerts.
3- HTML based alert
Selenium can handle HTML alert using webelements.

Hard Assertion
If assertion will fail. My test execution will not go
to the next line. It will directly stop exection and it will throw the exception.
